This dataset is comprised of the intake and outcome record from the Long Beach Animal Shelter during 2017-2024. This analysis focuses on cats only. 


IF a primary_color or intake_condition is changed in the original dataset (Longbeach), be sure to update the function(s) "recolor" or "recode_intake, OR it will be labelled as "other". 
IF "other" appears in the analysis a new color has been introduced that needs to be labelled. 

Run "Longbeach Cats.R" and then render "Longbeach Cats Document.qmd"
